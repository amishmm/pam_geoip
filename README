pam_geoip - GeoIP account management module for (Linux-)PAM

This PAM module provides GeoIP checking for logins. The user can be allowed
or denied based on the location of the originating IP address. This is
similar to pam_access(8), but uses a GeoIP2 City or GeoIP2 Country database
instead of host name / IP matching.

The matching in pam_geoip is done on given country and city names or on
distance from a given location. With a Country database only matches
of the originating country are possible.

This PAM module provides the "account" hook only. To use this module, add a
line like (optional parts in square brackets)

  account required pam_geoip.so [system_file=file] [geoip_db=file] \
	[action=name] [language=name] [debug]

to the relevant files in /etc/pam.d/ and configure your
/etc/security/geoip.conf and/or /etc/security/geoip.SERVICE.conf.

Requirements:

Debian (lenny, squeeze, sid [Linux, kFreeBSD]):
  building: libmaxminddb-dev, libpam0g-dev, perl (pod2man)
  running: libmaxminddb, libpam0g, libpam-{modules,runtime}, a GeoIP2 City
     database or a GeoIP Country database, see
